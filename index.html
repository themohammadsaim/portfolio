                                public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones, secured internet access
                                through Internet Gateways, and comprehensive network access controls using Network ACLs

                                <br><strong>VPC Creation</strong>
                                I started by creating a new VPC named "HYD VPC" with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16. This
                                VPC would serve as the foundation for the entire infrastructure. <br>
                            </p2>

                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Subnet Creation</strong>
                                Next, I proceeded to create the 10 subnets within the VPC, ensuring that the required
                                configuration was met. I defined 5 public subnets and 5 private subnets, each with a
                                specific CIDR block:
                                <br>Public Subnets:

                                <br>- Subnet 1 (AZ-A): 10.0.0.0/20

                                <br>- Subnet 2 (AZ-B): 10.0.32.0/20

                                <br>- Subnet 3 (AZ-C): 10.0.64.0/20

                                <br>- Subnet 4 (AZ-B): 10.0.96.0/20

                                <br>- Subnet 5 (AZ-C): 10.0.128.0/20<br>

                                <br>Private Subnets:

                                <br>- Subnet 1 (AZ-B): 10.0.16.0/20

                                <br>- Subnet 2 (AZ-C): 10.0.48.0/20

                                <br>- Subnet 3 (AZ-A): 10.0.80.0/20

                                <br>- Subnet 4 (AZ-B): 10.0.112.0/20

                                <br>- Subnet 5 (AZ-C): 10.0.144.0/20

                                <br>This arrangement ensured that the public and private subnets were logically
                                separated
                                within the VPC. <br>
                            </p2>

                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Internet Gateway Creation</strong>
                                To provide internet connectivity to the public subnets, I created an Internet Gateway
                                named "HYD VPC Internet Gateway" and attached it to the VPC. <br>
                            </p2>

                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Route Table Configuration</strong>
                                I then created two route tables: one for the public subnets and one for the private
                                subnets.

                                <br>The Public Route Table ("PUBLIC RT") was associated with all the public subnets and
                                had
                                a route to the Internet Gateway for 0.0.0.0/0, allowing internet access.

                                <br>The Private Route Table ("PRIVATE RT") was associated with all the private subnets
                                and had a route to the Public Route Table for 10.0.0.0/16, enabling internal
                                communication within the VPC.
                                <br>
                            </p2>

                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Network ACL Configuration</strong>
                                To control the inbound and outbound traffic to the subnets, I created a Network ACLs:
                                <br>-I associated Network ACL with all the public and private subnets. <br>
                            </p2>
                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Security Group Configuration</strong>
                                I defined two security groups to manage the traffic within the VPC:
                                <br>- Public Subnet Security Group ("HYD Public SG") allowed all inbound and outbound
                                <br>- Private Subnet Security Group ("HYD Private SG ") allowed all inbound and outbound
                                traffic within the VPC.
                                traffic. <br>
                                These security groups were then assigned to the respective EC2 instances launched in
                                the public and private subnets. <br>
                            </p2>
                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>EC2 Instance Deployment</strong>
                                Finally, I launched 10 EC2 instances, with 5 instances in the public subnets and 5
                                instances in the private subnets. The instances were named accordingly, such as " [A]
                                HYD Public EC2 2b" and "[A] HYD Private EC2 2b".<br>
                            </p2>
                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Verification and Testing</strong>
                                After completing the deployment, I conducted a series of verification steps to ensure
                                the proper functioning of the VPC setup: <br>
                            </p2>

                                <br><strong>Conclusion</strong>
                                The VPC deployment in the Hyderabad region has been successfully completed, meeting all
                                the requirements set forth for the project. The public subnets are now connected to the
                                internet, while the private subnets remain isolated, ensuring a secure and
                                well-structured cloud infrastructure. The verification steps confirmed the proper
                                functioning of the VPC and its components, giving me confidence in the overall solution.

                                I began by setting up an ECS cluster on the AWS Management Console. This served as the
                                foundational structure for managing my containerized application.<br>
                            </p2>

                                Next, I defined the specific configuration for my container in a task definition. This
                                included specifying the container image location (Docker repository), allocating the
                                necessary memory and CPU resources, and defining port mappings.<br>
                            </p2>
                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Service Creation</strong>
                                With the task definition ready, I created an ECS service. This service determined the
                                desired number of instances of my container to run and managed their lifecycle.<br>
                            </p2>
                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Network Configuration</strong>
                                To ensure my application was accessible, I configured the network settings for the
                                service. I carefully selected the appropriate network mode, such as AWS Fargate or EC2, based on my project requirements.<br>
                            </p2>
                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Deployment and Verification</strong>
                                Once the service was created, ECS handled the deployment of the container instances. I
                                closely monitored the deployment process to ensure everything went smoothly. After
                                successful deployment, I accessed my application using the provided endpoint to verify
                                its functionality.<br>

                                By following these steps, I successfully deployed my containerized application using
                                Amazon ECS. This hands-on experience significantly enhanced my understanding of
                                container orchestration and the advantages of using managed services like ECS. I was
                                impressed by ECS's ability to manage containerized workloads efficiently, offering
                                scalability, high availability, and optimized resource utilization.

                                <br>One function to start instances at the beginning of the workday.
                                <br>Another function to stop instances at the end of the workday.
                                <br>Integrated these Lambda functions with the appropriate IAM roles to enforce security
                                policies.
                            </p2>
                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>CloudWatch Events Scheduling</strong>
                                With the task definition ready, I created an ECS service. This service determined the
                                desired number of instances of my container to run and managed their lifecycle.
                            </p2>
                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Network Configuration</strong>
                                Set up Amazon CloudWatch Events to trigger the Lambda functions at specific times:
                                <br>Scheduled the instance start function for 8:00 AM daily.
                                <br>Scheduled the instance stop function for 5:00 PM daily.
                                <br>Ensured seamless and automated operation of EC2 instances within defined working
                                hours.
                            </p2>
                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong>
                                By scheduling EC2 instances to start and stop only during business hours, the company
                                reduces unnecessary running costs associated with 24/7 operation.
                            </p2>
                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Automated Management</strong>
                                Utilizes AWS Lambda and CloudWatch Events to automate instance management, reducing
                                manual intervention and administrative overhead
                            </p2>
                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Scalability and Flexibility</strong>
                                The serverless architecture allows for easy scalability and modifications to the
                                schedule without impacting the underlying infrastructure.
                            </p2>

                                overall well-being.
                                <br>As an AI enthusiast with a passion for health and wellness, I embarked on a project
                                to create a personalized nutrition chatbot: Enlivena. Leveraging the powerful
                                capabilities of AWS PartyRock, a platform designed to streamline AI development, I was
                                able to bring this vision to life.
                                <br>I chose the name Enlivena for the chatbot to reflect its core mission: to invigorate
                                and enhance user's wellness journeys. Derived from the word "enliven" which means to
                                make something more lively and energizing, Enlivena embodies the essence of
                                revitalization and positive transformation in health.

                                <br><strong>Development</strong>
                                The development process with AWS PartyRock was a breeze. The platform's pre-built
                                components and integration capabilities allowed me to focus on the core functionality of
                                Enlivena, rather than getting bogged down in technical complexities. This accelerated
                                development time and ensured a seamless user experience.

                                <br><strong>Image Generation</strong>
                                For generating high-quality images, I used Stable Diffusion XL, a state-of-the-art
                                latent diffusion model. This model leverages denoising diffusion probabilistic models
                                (DDPMs) to iteratively refine image outputs, resulting in photorealistic images based on
                                textual prompts. The architecture of Stable Diffusion XL is particularly effective at
                                generating detailed and contextually accurate visuals.
                            </p2>

                                <br><strong>Text Generation</strong>
                                To handle text generation, I implemented Claude 3 Sonnet, a sophisticated AI model known
                                for its natural language processing capabilities. Claude 3 Sonnet is built on a
                                transformer-based architecture optimized for generating contextually relevant and
                                creative text. This model is ideal for producing coherent and engaging content across
                                diverse topics.
                            </p2>

                                <br><strong>Interactive Conversational AI</strong>
                                For the chatbot functionality, I integrated Llama 3.1 Instruct 70b, a large language
                                model designed for dynamic and interactive dialogues. With its 70 billion parameters,
                                Llama 3.1 Instruct 70b provides advanced conversational capabilities, delivering
                                human-like responses that enhance user interactions. This model is particularly
                                well-suited for applications requiring a nuanced understanding of context and natural
                                language.
                            </p2>

                                <br><strong>Future Improvements</strong>
                                To further enhance this application, I am considering several improvements
                            </p2>
                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Model Fine-Tuning</strong>
                                I plan to fine-tune each AI model on domain-specific datasets to improve the accuracy
                                and relevance of generated content. By retraining the models with targeted data, I can
                                refine their outputs to better align with specific use cases or audience needs.
                            </p2>

                                <br><strong>Enhanced Model Integration</strong>
                                Developing a more sophisticated orchestration layer to manage interactions between the
                                models could improve performance. This would involve creating a context-aware system
                                that dynamically switches between models based on user inputs, ensuring a more seamless
                                and efficient user experience.

                                For this project, I set out to visualize a large dataset using Amazon QuickSight. Hereâ€™s
                                how I approached it:</p2>
                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Data Acquisition:</strong>
                                1. I began by downloading a dataset containing 50,000 best-selling Amazon products from
                                GitHub.
                                <br>2. After downloading, I saved the dataset, which was in CSV format, locally for the
                                next steps.
                            </p2>
                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Data Storage:</strong>
                                1. I created an Amazon S3 bucket named 'amazon-data-viz-project' using the AWS
                                Management Console.
                                <br>2. I then uploaded the CSV dataset to the S3 bucket I had just created.
                            </p2>
                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Data Integration with QuickSight:</strong>
                                1. I set up an Amazon QuickSight account and linked it to the S3 bucket containing my
                                dataset.
                                <br>2. I imported a new dataset into QuickSight using an S3 manifest file I created to
                                provide the necessary metadata.
                            </p2>
                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Data Visualization:</strong>
                                1. Within QuickSight, I created an interactive sheet to visualize the imported dataset.
                                <br>2. I generated a bar chart to display the most popular brands based on product
                                frequencyin the dataset.
                                <br>3. To highlight the most frequently occurring brands, I sorted the chart in
                                descending order.
                                <br>4. I explored additional visualizations, such as comparisons of product prices,
                                top-selling product titles, and seller performance, utilizing various chart types
                                offered by QuickSight.
                            </p2>

                                <br><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
                                This project effectively leveraged Amazon QuickSight to visualize and analyze a large
                                dataset. By systematically following each step, I was able to transform raw data stored
                                in Amazon S3 into insightful visualizations. These visualizations provided a
                                comprehensive overview of key metrics, such as brand popularity, product pricing,
                                top-selling items, and seller performance. The process demonstrated the capabilities of
                                Amazon QuickSight as a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making and highlighted its
                                potential to derive meaningful insights from extensive datasets.

                            <h5>Built & hosted a static website on AWS using Amazon S3</h5>
                            <p2><br><strong>Project Overview</strong>This project involves building and hosting a static
                                website using Amazon S3(Simple Storage Service) on AWS(Amazon Web Services). The main
                                goals were to leverage S3's scalable and reliable storage for hosting static web content
                                (like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files) and to implement best practices for performance,
                                security, and cost-effectiveness.

                                <br><strong>Configuring Website Hosting</strong>
                                I started by creating an S3 bucket using the AWS Management Console. This bucket would
                                act as the storage location for all the files that make up my website.
                            </p2>
                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Setting Object Permissions</strong>
                                With the hosting configured, I uploaded all the necessary files for my website,
                                including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images, to the S3 bucket.
                            </p2>
                            <p2>
                                <br><strong>Task Definition Creation</strong>
                                To make my website publicly accessible, I adjusted the permissions of the uploaded files
                                to ensure they were publicly readable. This allowed anyone with the website's URL to
                                access and view the content.

                            <p2><br><strong>Conclusion</strong>By following these steps, I successfully hosted my static
                                website on AWS S3. The process was both straightforward and efficient, providing me with
                                a
                                cost-effective and scalable solution for hosting my site. Leveraging S3 for website
                                hosting not only simplified deployment but also ensured that my website could handle
                                varying levels of traffic with ease.</p2>

                <h4><span>Beyond</span>&nbsp;the Tech</h4>
                <p><br>When I'm not geeking out over <span>cloud computing</span> you'll catch me in a whole different
                    world of fun:<br><br>- Hitting the ping pong table to relax.<br>- Capturing life's quirky moments
                    through my camera lens.
                    <br>- Perfecting my swirls and loops in calligraphy.<br>
                    <br>I'm also into podcasts that dig into philosophy, psychology, history, political science and
                    economics.<br><br>I love learning about new stuff, but I'm also all about treating people with
                    respect and lending a hand whenever I can. I'm excited to find a place where I can bring my blend of
                    creativity and tech skills to make a real impact while keeping things fun and evolving along the
                    way.
